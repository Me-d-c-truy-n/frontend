## Features

- Users search for novels as desired, can search by name, by author, by year of publication,...
- Users choose novels to read.
- During the reading process, users can adjust the components displayed on the story reading frame (eg: change text size, font, background color, text color, line spacing, ...).
- In addition, the application also helps users store the status of the novels they are reading, and at the same time helps users quickly move to each specific chapter, episode, and page of the story to continue following.
- Users can export the stories they are reading to ebook files (prc, epub, pdf, ...) so they can easily continue reading on specialized devices.
